Assignment on MatLab 
1. MATLAB Stateflow
1. Design a Stateflow chart to simulate a washing machine cycle with states such as Fill,
Wash, Rinse, Spin, and Done. Define each state's operation and simulate the flow
from start to end.
2. Construct a Stateflow chart for an elevator control system. The elevator should have
states for each floor (e.g., Floor 1, Floor 2, etc.) and transitions for Up and Down.
Add logic for door open/close.
2. MATLAB Programming
1. Develop a MATLAB script that simulates and plots the trajectory of a projectile. Take
into account initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration. Plot the
range and maximum height.
2. Write a MATLAB script to generate a sequence of random numbers and plot them as a line
graph.
3. Simulink
1. Develop a Simulink model for an RC circuit and simulate its response to a step input
voltage. Plot the charging and discharging curve of the capacitor and analyze the time
constant.
2. Create a Simulink model to simulate the temperature change in a water tank as it heats up
over time. Use a basic heat source and observe the temperature rise.
4. PID Control in MATLAB/Simulink
 1. tf=(s3-s+10)/(s4+3s^2-20)
 2. tf=(s3+2s^2+s+10)/(s4+3s-20)
